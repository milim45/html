<h2> personal info </h2>
  
<p>
I'm 40+ years old, married with two kids <br/>
I really love learning new things, in all areas, from cooking vegiterian food to new coding languages<br/>
I have been in QA for a few years,in a retail software company<br/>
</p>

<h2>education</h2>

<p class="box">
the last time i studied in a formal institution was when i aquired a BA in <a href="https://humanities.tau.ac.il/philosophy/", target="_blank">philosophy</a><br/>
this is a degree you can't use in "real life" but it was fascinating and allowed me to develop my "brain" skills:<br/>
an ability to analyze that helps solving problems<br/>
an ability to examine an issue from different point of view that helps a lot in software design<br/>
inclusion and industion that help in coding<br/>
etc..<br/>
<p/>

<p class="box">
the effect of the philosophy studies is still present in aspects of my  daily life
</p><div>

<p class="box">
another thing i learn in the univesity is to be an autodidact<br/>
reading a text writen by<a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%98" >Immanuel Kant</a> in German, then translated to English and Then translated to Hebrew..<br/>
takes a lot of patience and determination <br/>
also, Kant invented new words and then used them thrue his books, so i  needed to study and implement new cocepts<br/>
a little like learning a new coding language...<br/><div>
</p>

<p class="box">
after the intelectual adventure, i looked for a work field that will allow me to combine thinking and problem solving  <br/>
with the ability to make a difference and see results for my effort.<br/>
in qa i find both chalenges and sutisfation, and I am looking forward to develop my skills in this area <br/>
