<h1> <div class="big"> hi, this is my website <div> </h1>

<h2>hi, my name is MILI</h2>
<p>my parents gave me this name, to honor my grand mother Milka.<br/>
they thaught that Mili would be nicer name that Milka.
that was before the famous chocolad Milka came to Israel (-:</BR>

I'm 40+ years old <br/>
I enjoy long walks and photografing of interesting momnets that i come across<br/>
I really love learning new things, in all areas, from cooking vegiterian food to new coding languages<br/>
lately i am trying to combine new thing in everything i do:
<ul>
<li>i listen to podcusts while clening the house</li>
<li>loan books from the library while waiting to pick up kids from they're activities</li>
<li> exercise while cooking</li>
</ul>
<p/>
as long as i enjoy....

<h2>studying</h2>

<p>
the last time i studied in a formal institution was many years ago.<br/>
i studied a BA in <a href="https://humanities.tau.ac.il/philosophy/", target="_blank">philosophy</a>
this is a degree you can't use in "real life" but it was fascinating and allowed me to develop my "brain" skills:
<ul>
<li>an ability to analyze that helps solving problems</li>
<li>an ability to examine an issue from different point of view that helps a lot in software design</li>
<li> inclusion and industion that help in coding</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<p/>

<p>
the effect of the philosophy studies is still present in aspects of my  daily life
</p>

<p>
another thing i learn in the univesity is to be an autodidact<br/>
it's hard to describe the experience of reading a test writen by<a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%98" >Immanuel Kant</a> in German, then translated to English and Then translated to Hebrew..<br/>
this takes a lot of patience and determination to try and understand what the guy tried to explain<br/>
also, he invented new words and then used them thrue his books, so i  needed to study and implement new cocepts<br/>
a little like learning a new coding language...<br/>
</p>

<p>
when i was a kid it was common to sort puplis to either human studies or math&sceience studies in an early age<br/>
i was assgned to human studies and did not get the chance to go on the known track of math -> computer sceience<br/>
but maybe if i had that chance i would miss all the fun of classic and academic studies<br/>
so now i am here, to make up for the lost time and learn how to code and QA<br/>
